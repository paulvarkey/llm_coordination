What action does my partner intend to take? 
Available Actions: 

A. Move to Room 2
B. Move to Room 6
C. Stay in current Room

INFERENCE: Explanation:  
Bob is currently in Room 1, and the door to Room 2 (where the thief is) is closed. Since the door between Room 1 and Room 2 is controlled by a button in Room 9, and only Alice is in Room 9 with access to the button, Bob cannot unlock the door himself. Moving to Room 6 would take him away from the thief, which is not optimal for coordinating to catch the thief. Therefore, the most strategic action for Bob is to stay in his current room and wait for Alice to open the door to Room 2.

Action: C. Stay in current Room

Can Bob plate and deliver a soup if I stay where I am for the rest of the game?

Available Answers: 
A. Yes.
B. No.
C. Not enough information.
INFERENCE: Explanation: Bob is holding a plate and is located near p0, which is blocked by Alice. The cooked soup at c0 is at Alice's location, and since Alice is not moving, Bob cannot access c0 to retrieve the cooked soup. Therefore, Bob cannot plate and deliver a soup under these conditions.

Available Actions:  
A. place plate on closest kitchen counter.
B. load soup on plate from c0.
C. load soup on plate from c1.
D. wait.
E. move away.

INFERENCE: Explanation: Bob is currently holding a plate and is at the plate dispenser (p0). The cookers (c0 and c1) are either blocked or still cooking, making it impossible for Bob to load soup onto the plate immediately. To facilitate coordination and maximize soup deliveries, Bob is likely to place the plate on the closest kitchen counter (k2) so that Alice can access it to load cooked soup and proceed with deliveries.

Does it make sense for both Bob and I to be holding a plate right now? 
Available Answers: 
A. Yes.
B. No.
C. Not enough information.
INFERENCE: Explanation: In the current game state, there is one soup being cooked at cooker c0 that requires a plate for loading and delivery. Since both Alice and Bob are holding empty plates, only one plate is necessary at this moment to handle the soup being cooked. Holding an extra plate does not contribute to the immediate task of loading and delivering the soup and could lead to unnecessary inventory management. Therefore, it does not make sense for both players to be holding a plate simultaneously in this context.

I see Bob is holding a cooked soup, does the environment allow for him to deliver it on his own? 
Available Answers: 
A. Yes.
B. No.
C. Not enough information.
INFERENCE: Explanation: According to the game rules, to deliver a soup, a player must first place the cooked soup onto a plate. This requires the player to be holding a plate.

Available Answers: 
A. No, we must leave room 1 immediately.
B. Generator 1 does not need anymore fixes.
C. Yes, we have time to at least partially fix generator 1.
INFERENCE: Explanation: The killer is currently in room 4 and will move to room 3 in the next turn. From room 3, the killer can reach room 1 in two more turns (moving through room 2 or room 5). This gives a total of three turns before the killer arrives in room 1. However, fixing the generator in room 1 requires four consecutive repair actions. Since there aren't enough turns to complete all required fixes before the killer arrives, there isn't sufficient time to fix the generator safely.

Answer: A. No, we must leave room 1 immediately.

EC QUESTION:


Based on the current stacks and my knowledge of my cards, how many of my cards can never be played in the future
Available Answers:
A. 0
B. 1
C. 2
D. 3
E. 4

INFERENCE: Explanation: Based on the current stacks and the discard pile, we can determine which cards can never be played in the future. The discard pile contains Red 4, Red 3, Yellow 5, Yellow 2, Yellow 4, Green 3, Green 2, Green 4, Green 1, White 4, White 3, White 2, White 5, and White 3. Therefore, any cards of these ranks and colors can never be played. 

For Alice:
- Card 0 could be: [Red, Yellow, Green, White, Blue] [2, 3, 4, 5]
  - Since Red 3, Red 4, Yellow 4, Yellow 5, Green 2, Green 3, Green 4, Green 5, White 2, White 3, White 4, White 5 are discarded, if Card 0 is any of these, it cannot be played. Therefore, Card 0 cannot be played.
- Card 1 could be: [Red, Yellow, Green, White, Blue] [1]
  - All color Rank 1 cards can still be played.
- Card 2 could be: [Red, Yellow, Green, White, Blue] [1]
  - All color Rank 1 cards can still be played.
- Card 3 could be: [Red, Green] [4]
  - Since Red 4 and Green 4 are discarded, Card 3 cannot be played.
- Card 4 could be: [Green] [5]
  - Since Green 5 is discarded, Card 4 cannot be played.

So, the number of Alice's cards that can never be played is 3 (Card 0, Card 3, Card 4).

INFERENCE: Explanation: Since we have only 1 life left, it is crucial to play cards only when we are sure they are the next in the sequence for their stack. Given the current stacks and the possible cards I have, none of my cards have clear enough information to confidently play them. Discarding is a safer option, and based on the conventions, discarding the oldest card is generally preferred.

INFERENCE: Explanation: Given that we only have 1 life left, we should avoid playing cards unless we are certain they will succeed. Since there are no reveal tokens left and no Play Clues can be given, we should discard a card to regain a reveal token. Discarding Card 0 is a safe option since it has multiple possible ranks and colors, reducing the risk of discarding a critical card.

INFERENCE: Explanation: Given the current state of the stacks, the only card that can be played next is Yellow 3, Green 2, Blue 4, or White 2. Since Bob's hand does not contain any of these cards, and we have 2 reveal tokens left, we should prioritize giving a Play Clue to Bob if possible. Revealing Bob's Red cards or rank 1 cards is unnecessary as the Red stack is complete and there are no immediate playable rank 1 cards. Revealing Bob's Blue cards or rank 5 cards is also unnecessary as they are not immediately playable. Revealing Bob's White cards will inform him that Card 2, Card 3, and Card 4 are White cards, but none are immediately playable. Therefore, revealing Bob's Green cards might help him understand the playable Green 2 card, which is critical for the Green stack.

Action: Reveal Bob's Green color cards.

What action does my partner intend to take? 

Available Actions: 
A. move to room 3
B. move to room 5
C. stay in current room

INFERENCE: Explanation: Since the exit gate is open and the killer is in room 7, Bob should move towards room 7 to escape. Moving to room 5 brings Bob closer to the exit gate while avoiding the killer, who is currently in room 7.

Action: B. move to room 5

What action should I take next? 

Available Actions: 
A. move to room 1
B. move to room 3
D. stay in current room

INFERENCE: Analysis: The exit gate is open, and the killer is staying in room 7 for this turn. Since the exit gate is in room 7, moving there directly would be risky as the killer is already there. Bob is in room 4, but since the exit gate is open, the primary goal is to reach room 7 safely. Moving to room 3 would bring you closer to room 4 and allow you to coordinate with Bob for a safer escape route.

Action: B. move to room 3
fuzzywuzzy: B

training example 55 :
EC QUESTION:
My name is Alice. I am in room 3. Bob is in room 5. Currently, we have information that the killer will certainly move to the room where Alice is. Generator in room 1 still needs 2 fix. Generator in room 2 is fixed. The exit gate is closed. 

Is my partner able to access generator 1 without encountering the killer?
Available Answers: 
A. Yes.
B. No.
C. Not enough information.

INFERENCE: Explanation: The killer will move to the room where Alice is (room 3). Bob is currently in room 5. To access generator 1, Bob can move directly from room 5 to room 1 without passing through room 3, where the killer will be.

What action does my partner intend to take? 

Available Actions: 
A. move to room 1
B. move to room 3
C. move to room 4
D. move to room 6
E. stay in current room

INFERENCE: Explanation: Since the killer is moving towards Alice in room 3, Bob's most strategic move would be to avoid the killer and possibly help with the generator in room 1, which still needs fixing. Moving to room 1 is a connected path and keeps Bob safe from the killer while progressing towards the objective.

Action: A. move to room 1
fuzzywuzzy: A

training example 55 :
JP QUESTION:
I am Alice. I am in room 3. Bob is in room 5. Currently, we have information that the killer will certainly move to the room where Alice is. Generator in room 1 still needs 2 fix. Generator in room 2 is fixed. The exit gate is closed.

What action should I take next? 

Available Actions: 
A. move to room 2
B. move to room 5
C. move to room 4
D. stay in current room

INFERENCE: Analysis: Since the killer will move to the room where Alice is, staying in room 3 will result in being caught. Moving to room 2 will not help as it is directly connected to room 3 and the killer can follow easily. Moving to room 5 will bring Alice closer to Bob, but it might compromise Bob's safety too. Moving to room 4 will distance Alice from the killer and provide an opportunity to move towards room 1 or room 5 later.

Action: C. move to room 4
fuzzywuzzy: C

training example 56 :
EC QUESTION:
My name is Alice. I am in room 1. Bob is also in room 1. Alice hasn't started fixing the generator. Currently, we have information that the killer will move to the room 3 from room 4 in this turn. Generator in room 1 still needs 4 fixes. Generator in room 2 is fixed. The exit gate is closed. 

Do we have time to fix the generator before the killer gets to room 1? 

Available Answers: 
A. No, we must leave room 1 immediately.
B. Generator 1 does not need anymore fixes.
C. Yes, we have time to at least partially fix generator 1.
INFERENCE: Explanation: The killer is moving from room 4 to room 3. From room 3, the killer can move to room 2, room 4, or room 5 in the next turn. Since room 1 is connected to room 2, room 5, and room 7, the killer will need at least two turns to reach room 1 (one turn to move to room 2 or room 5, and another turn to move to room 1). Therefore, Alice and Bob have time to at least partially fix generator 1 before the killer arrives.

Answer: C. Yes, we have time to at least partially fix generator 1.

TOM QUESTION:


Available Actions: 

A. move to room 2
B. move to room 5
C. move to room 7
D. fix generator in current room
E. stay in current room

INFERENCE: Explanation: Since the generator in room 1 still needs 4 fixes and the generator in room 2 is already fixed, the priority would be to start fixing the generator in room 1. The Killer is moving to room 3, which means it is not an immediate threat to Alice and Bob in room 1. Therefore, Bob is likely to start fixing the generator in room 1.

Action: D. fix generator in current room
fuzzywuzzy: D

training example 56 :
JP QUESTION:
I am Alice. I am in room 1. Bob is also in room 1. Alice hasn't started fixing the generator. Currently, we have information that the killer will move to the room 3 from room 4 in this turn. Generator in room 1 still needs 4 fixes. Generator in room 2 is fixed. The exit gate is closed. 

What action should I take next? 

Available Actions: 
A. move to room 2
B. move to room 5
C. move to room 7
D. stay in current room 

INFERENCE: Analysis: The killer is moving to room 3 from room 4, which means room 1 is currently safe. Bob is in the same room, and the generator in room 1 still needs 4 fixes. It's crucial to start fixing the generator as Bob can potentially help in subsequent turns. Since the killer is moving to room 3, it poses no immediate threat to room 1.

Action: D. stay in current room
fuzzywuzzy: D

training example 57 :
EC QUESTION:
My name is Alice. I am in room 1. Bob is in room 6. I was fixing the generator and there is only one more fix needed, which could be done before getting caught.

If i fix generator 1, is Bob in a position to escape? 

Available Answers: 
A. Yes, he's only one room away from the gate when it opens.
B. No, the killer is blocking his path to the exit gate.
C. No, we stil need to fix generator 2.
INFERENCE: Explanation: If Alice fixes the generator in room 1, the exit gate will open. Bob is in room 6, which is directly connected to room 7 where the exit gate is located. Therefore, Bob can move to room 7 in the next turn and escape.

Answer: A. Yes, he's only one room away from the gate when it opens.

I am Alice. I am in room 1. Bob is in room 6. Generator in room 1 requires 1 more fix. Currently, we have information that the killer will move to the room 1 after this turn. Generator in room 2 is fixed. The exit gate is closed. 

What action does my partner intend to take? 


Available Actions: 
A. move to room 5
B. move to room 7
C. stay in current room

INFERENCE: Explanation: Since the killer is moving to room 1, it would be dangerous for Bob to move towards room 1 or stay in room 6 without a clear strategy. The objective is to fix the generator and open the exit gate. By moving to room 5, Bob can potentially support Alice by being closer to room 1 or have more flexibility to navigate the rooms to avoid the killer and eventually move towards the exit gate once it opens.

Action: A. move to room 5

What action should I take next? 

Available Actions: 
A. move to room 5
B. move to room 7
C. fix generator in room 1
D. stay in current room 

INFERENCE: Analysis: Given that the killer is moving to room 1, staying in room 1 would result in being caught. Bob is in room 6 and would not be able to assist immediately. Fixing the generator in room 1 would be ideal, but it's risky since the killer is heading to room 1. Moving to room 7 would place you closer to the exit gate and away from the killer.

Available Answers: 
A. No, we can get to the gate perfectly fine.
B. Yes, the killer is currently blocking the path to the gate.
C. Not enough information.
INFERENCE: Explanation: The killer is moving to the Backyard area, which is directly connected to the Gate area. Since the killer is closest to the Gate area, it will be blocking the path to the gate.

What action does my partner intend to take? 


Available Actions: 
A. move to Parking area
B. move to Backyard area
C. move to Centerhub area
D. fix generator in current area
E. stay in current area

INFERENCE: Explanation: Since both generators are fixed and the exit gate is open, Bob's priority will be to move towards the Gate area to escape. The shortest path from the Warehouse to the Gate area is through the Backyard area. Although the Killer is moving to the Backyard area, Bob might take the risk to get closer to the exit.

Available Actions: 
A. move to Centerhub area
B. move to Parking area
C. move to Forest area
D. stay in current area

INFERENCE: Analysis: The killer is moving to the Backyard area, which is directly connected to the Gate area. Since the exit gate is opened, both you (Alice) and Bob need to move towards the Gate area to escape. Bob is currently in the Warehouse area, which is connected to the Backyard. The killer will be in the Backyard after this turn, so Bob should avoid moving to the Backyard. You are currently in the Kitchen area, which is connected to the Forest, Centerhub, and Parking areas. Moving to the Centerhub area will bring you closer to the Backyard and the Gate area.

Action: A. move to Centerhub area
fuzzywuzzy: A

If i were to move towards Parking area, would I be leading the killer towards Bob? 

Available Answers: 
A. No.
B. Yes.
C. Not enough information.

INFERENCE: Explanation: The killer is following Alice and is currently in the Backyard area, which is directly connected to the Centerhub area where Alice is. If Alice moves to the Parking area, the killer will follow Alice and move towards the Centerhub area, which is closer to the Forest area where Bob is. Therefore, Alice moving towards the Parking area will lead the killer towards Bob.

Is the killer currently blocking my path to the exit gate? 

Available Answers: 
A. Yes.
B. No.
C. Not enough information.
D. We have no path to the exit gate.
INFERENCE: Explanation: To determine if the killer is blocking Alice's path to the exit gate, we need to check if the killer is in a room that Alice must pass through to reach the Gate area. Alice is in the Forest area, and the Gate area is directly connected to the Backyard, which is connected to the Forest. The killer is in the Kitchen area, which is connected to the Forest but not directly blocking the path to the Backyard or Gate.

Available Answers:
A. 0
B. 1
C. 2

E. 4
INFERENCE: Explanation: The current stacks are Red 1, Yellow 2, Green 1, White 2, Blue 2. Based on Bob's cards:
- Bob's Card 0 (Yellow 1) is not playable because Yellow 2 is already on the stack.
- Bob's Card 1 (White 1) is not playable because White 2 is already on the stack.
- Bob's Card 2 (White 4) is not playable because White 3 is not on the stack.
- Bob's Card 3 (Yellow 3) is playable because Yellow 2 is on the stack.
- Bob's Card 4 (White 5) is not playable because White 4 is not on the stack.

Based on the current stacks and my knowledge, how many of my cards are playable 
Available Answers:
A. 0
B. 1
C. 2
D. 3
E. 4
INFERENCE: Explanation: Based on the current stacks, the only playable cards are those that can be immediately placed on top of the existing stacks. The current stacks are Red 1, Yellow 2, Green 1, White 4, and Blue 3. Therefore, the playable cards would be Red 2, Yellow 3, Green 2, White 5, and Blue 4. 

For each of Alice's cards:
- Card 0 could be any color and any rank (1-5), so it is not guaranteed to be playable.
- Card 1 could be any color and any rank (1, 2, 3, 5), so it is not guaranteed to be playable.
- Card 2 could be any color and any rank (1, 2, 3, 5), so it is not guaranteed to be playable.
- Card 3 is specifically a rank 3 card, which is not playable in any stack.
- Card 4 is specifically a White 5 card, which is playable on the White stack.

Thus, only Card 4 is guaranteed to be playable.

INFERENCE: Explanation: Given that Bob's action history includes multiple reveals and discards, it indicates that Bob might have been trying to provide useful information or regain reveal tokens. Considering the conventions, particularly "Do Not Repeat Known Information" and "Play with Fear," and given that we have only 2 lives left, the safest approach would be to play a card only if we are sure it is the next in the sequence. Since Card 4 is known to be White 5 and can be played on the White stack, it is the safest play.

Based on the current stacks and my knowledge of my cards, how many of my cards can never be played in the future
Available Answers:
A. 0
B. 1
C. 2
D. 3
E. 4

INFERENCE: Explanation: To determine how many of Alice's cards can never be played, we need to compare the possibilities with the current stacks and discard pile. 
- Card 0 could be: [Red, Yellow, Green, White, Blue] [2, 3, 4, 5]. Since Red 2, Yellow 4, Green 1, White 1, and Blue 2 are already in stacks, and the discard pile includes Yellow 4, White 4, White 5, Green 4, Green 3, Green 2, Red 4, Red 3, Yellow 5, Yellow 2, Green 1, White 3, White 2, White 3, none of these cards can be played in the future.
- Card 1 could be: [Red, Yellow, Green, White, Blue] [1]. All these rank 1 cards can potentially be played.
- Card 2 could be: [Red, Yellow, Green, White, Blue] [1]. All these rank 1 cards can potentially be played.
- Card 3 could be: [Red, Green] [4]. Since Red 4 is in the discard pile, and Green 4 is also in the discard pile, this card cannot be played.
- Card 4 could be: [Green] [5]. Since Green 5 is not in the discard pile, it can still be played.

Thus, Card 0 and Card 3 can never be played in the future.

Available Answers:
A. 0
B. 1

INFERENCE: Explanation: To determine how many of Bob's cards are the last of their kind, we need to check if any of Bob's cards are the only remaining cards of their rank and color combination. Given the discard pile and current stacks, we can analyze Bob's cards:

- White 4: Not the last of its kind (White 4 already in discard pile)
- Red 5: The last of its kind (unique card in the deck)
- Yellow 3: Not the last of its kind (Yellow 3 not in discard pile, but not unique)
- Green 5: The last of its kind (unique card in the deck)
- Green 3: Not the last of its kind (Green 3 not in discard pile, but not unique)

My name is Alice. I am in room 2. Bob is in room 4. Currently, we have information that the killer will stay in room 7 for this turn. Generator in room 1 is fix. Generator in room 2 is fixed. The exit gate is opened. 

Does the killer need to be lured away before we can access the gate? 

Available Answers: 
A. No, we can get to the gate perfectly fine.
B. Yes, the killer is currently blocking the path to the gate.
C. Not enough information. 
INFERENCE: Explanation: The exit gate is in room 7, which is currently occupied by the killer. Since the killer catches survivors if they are in the same room after a turn, the killer needs to be lured away from room 7 to access the gate safely.

Answer: B. Yes, the killer is currently blocking the path to the gate.

TOM QUESTION:
I am Alice. I am in room 2. Bob is in room 4. Currently, we have information that the killer will stay in room 7 for this turn. Generator in room 1 is fix. Generator in room 2 is fixed. The exit gate is opened. 

What action does my partner intend to take? 

Available Actions: 
A. move to room 3
B. move to room 5
C. stay in current room

INFERENCE: Explanation: Since the exit gate is open and both generators are fixed, the primary objective is to escape. The shortest path for Bob (in room 4) to reach the exit gate (in room 7) would be through room 5 and then room 6. Moving to room 5 aligns with this objective and avoids the risk of encountering the killer in room 7 immediately.

Action: B. move to room 5

JP QUESTION:
I am Alice. I am in room 2. Bob is in room 4. Currently, we have information that the killer will stay in room 7 for this turn. Generator in room 1 is fixed. Generator in room 2 is fixed. The exit gate is opened. 

What action should I take next? 

Available Actions: 
A. move to room 1
B. move to room 3
D. stay in current room

INFERENCE: Analysis: The exit gate is open, and the killer is staying in room 7. Bob is in room 4, and I am in room 2. To win the game, one of us needs to reach the exit gate in room 7. Since the killer is in room 7, it is risky to move directly to room 7. I should move closer to the exit gate while avoiding the killer. Moving to room 3 will bring me closer to room 6, and eventually room 7, while minimizing the risk of encountering the killer immediately.

Action: B. move to room 3

training example 121 :
EC QUESTION:
My name is Alice. I am in room 3. Bob is in room 5. Currently, we have information that the killer will certainly move to the room where Alice is. Generator in room 1 still needs 2 fix. Generator in room 2 is fixed. The exit gate is closed. 

Is my partner able to access generator 1 without encountering the killer?
Available Answers: 
A. Yes.
B. No.
C. Not enough information.

INFERENCE: Explanation: The killer is moving towards Alice in room 3. Bob is in room 5 and can move to room 1 directly, avoiding the killer who is moving to room 3.

TOM QUESTION:

What action does my partner intend to take? 

Available Actions: 
A. move to room 1
B. move to room 3
C. move to room 4
D. move to room 6
E. stay in current room

INFERENCE: Explanation: Given that the killer is moving towards Alice's current location (room 3), Bob will likely want to avoid moving closer to the killer to ensure his own safety and to potentially continue repairing the generator in room 1. Moving to room 1 would be a strategic action to start repairing the generator, while moving to room 3 would put him in immediate danger. Moving to room 4 or room 6 might be unnecessary since room 1 is a priority for generator repair.

Action: A. move to room 1
fuzzywuzzy: A

training example 121 :
JP QUESTION:
I am Alice. I am in room 3. Bob is in room 5. Currently, we have information that the killer will certainly move to the room where Alice is. Generator in room 1 still needs 2 fix. Generator in room 2 is fixed. The exit gate is closed.

What action should I take next? 

Available Actions: 
A. move to room 2
B. move to room 5
C. move to room 4
D. stay in current room

INFERENCE: Analysis: The killer will move to room 3 where Alice is currently located. If Alice stays in room 3, she will be caught. Bob is in room 5, which is connected to room 3. To avoid being caught, Alice should move to a different room. Moving to room 2 or room 4 will increase the distance between Alice and the killer, giving Bob more time to work on the generator in room 1 or to plan an escape route.

Action: C. move to room 4
fuzzywuzzy: C

training example 122 :
EC QUESTION:
My name is Alice. I am in room 1. Bob is also in room 1. Alice hasn't started fixing the generator. Currently, we have information that the killer will move to the room 3 from room 4 in this turn. Generator in room 1 still needs 4 fixes. Generator in room 2 is fixed. The exit gate is closed. 

Do we have time to fix the generator before the killer gets to room 1? 

Available Answers: 
A. No, we must leave room 1 immediately.
B. Generator 1 does not need anymore fixes.
C. Yes, we have time to at least partially fix generator 1.
INFERENCE: Explanation: The killer is moving to room 3 from room 4. It will take the killer at least two turns to reach room 1 (moving from room 3 to room 2, and then from room 2 to room 1). We can use the first turn to start fixing the generator and the second turn to either continue fixing or move to another room if necessary.

Answer: C. Yes, we have time to at least partially fix generator 1.

TOM QUESTION:


Available Actions: 

A. move to room 2
B. move to room 5
C. move to room 7
D. fix generator in current room
E. stay in current room

INFERENCE: Explanation: Since the generator in room 1 still needs 4 fixes and Bob is in room 1 with Alice, the best course of action for Bob is to start fixing the generator. This is because fixing the generator is essential for opening the exit gate, and both survivors should work together to ensure it gets fixed as soon as possible, especially since the killer is moving to room 3 and won't be an immediate threat to room 1.

Action: D. fix generator in current room
fuzzywuzzy: D

training example 122 :
JP QUESTION:
I am Alice. I am in room 1. Bob is also in room 1. Alice hasn't started fixing the generator. Currently, we have information that the killer will move to the room 3 from room 4 in this turn. Generator in room 1 still needs 4 fixes. Generator in room 2 is fixed. The exit gate is closed. 

What action should I take next? 

Available Actions: 
A. move to room 2
B. move to room 5
C. move to room 7
D. stay in current room 

INFERENCE: Analysis: The killer is moving to room 3, which means it is currently not a threat to us in room 1. Since the generator in room 1 still needs 4 fixes, it would be beneficial to start fixing it. Bob can also help with the repairs. The killer is likely to move towards room 2 or room 5 next, as these rooms are closest to room 3 and could potentially have survivors in them. Staying in room 1 allows us to start fixing the generator without immediate danger.

Action: D. stay in current room
fuzzywuzzy: D

training example 123 :
EC QUESTION:
My name is Alice. I am in room 1. Bob is in room 6. I was fixing the generator and there is only one more fix needed, which could be done before getting caught. Currently, we have information that the killer will move to the room 1 after this turn. Generator in room 1 still needs 1 fix. Generator in room 2 is fixed. The exit gate is closed. 

If i fix generator 1, is Bob in a position to escape? 

Available Answers: 
A. Yes, he's only one room away from the gate when it opens.
B. No, the killer is blocking his path to the exit gate.
C. No, we stil need to fix generator 2.
INFERENCE: Explanation: Bob is in room 6, which is directly connected to room 7 where the exit gate is located. If Alice fixes generator 1, the exit gate will open immediately after the turn. Since Bob is only one room away from the gate, he can move to room 7 and escape in the next turn. 

Answer: A. Yes, he's only one room away from the gate when it opens.

training example 123 :
TOM QUESTION:
I am Alice. I am in room 1. Bob is in room 6. Generator in room 1 requires 1 more fix. Currently, we have information that the killer will move to the room 1 after this turn. Generator in room 2 is fixed. The exit gate is closed. 

What action does my partner intend to take? 


Available Actions: 
A. move to room 5
B. move to room 7
C. stay in current room

INFERENCE: Explanation: Since the killer is moving to room 1, it would be unsafe for Bob to move to room 1 to help with the generator. Bob's best option is to move closer to the exit gate to be in a better position once the generators are fixed. 

Action: B. move to room 7

JP QUESTION:
I am Alice. I am in room 1. Bob is in room 6. I was fixing the generator and there is only one more fix needed, which could be done before getting caught. Currently, we have information that the killer will move to the room 1 after this turn. Generator in room 1 still needs 1 fix. Generator in room 2 is fixed. The exit gate is closed. 

What action should I take next? 

Available Actions: 
A. move to room 5
B. move to room 7
C. fix generator in room 1
D. stay in current room 

INFERENCE: Analysis: The killer is moving to room 1, which means staying in room 1 or fixing the generator will result in being caught. Bob is in room 6, which is connected to room 5 and room 7. Since the generator in room 1 needs only one more fix to be completed, it is crucial to complete this fix. However, since the killer will be in room 1 after this turn, moving to a connected room will allow you to avoid being caught and potentially give Bob more time to reach the exit gate once the generators are fixed.

Action: A. move to room 5

EC QUESTION:
My name is Alice. I am in Kitchen area. Bob is in warehouse area. Killer will move to Backyard area from Gate area in this turn. Generator in Forest area is fixed. Generator in Warehouse is fixed. The exit gate in the Gate is opened. 

Does the killer need to be lured away before we can access the gate? 

Available Answers: 
A. No, we can get to the gate perfectly fine.
B. Yes, the killer is currently blocking the path to the gate.
C. Not enough information.
INFERENCE: Explanation: The Killer will move to Backyard area from Gate area in this turn. Since Backyard is directly connected to Gate, the Killer will be in a room that blocks the path to the Gate, making it risky for survivors to access the gate without being caught.

Answer: B. Yes, the killer is currently blocking the path to the gate.

What action does my partner intend to take? 


Available Actions: 
A. move to Parking area
B. move to Backyard area
C. move to Centerhub area
D. fix generator in current area
E. stay in current area

INFERENCE: Explanation: Since both generators are fixed and the exit gate is open, Bob's priority should be to move towards the Gate area to escape. Given that the Killer is moving to the Backyard area, Bob will try to avoid the Killer and move towards the Gate through a safer route. The best option for Bob is to move to the Centerhub area, as it provides multiple pathways to navigate towards the Gate area while avoiding the Killer.

Action: C. move to Centerhub area
fuzzywuzzy: C

JP QUESTION:
I am Alice. I am in Kitchen area. Bob is in warehouse area. Killer will move to Backyard area from Gate area in this turn. Generator in Forest area is fixed. Generator in Warehouse is fixed. The exit gate in the Gate is opened. 

What action should I take next? 

Available Actions: 
A. move to Centerhub area
B. move to Parking area
C. move to Forest area
D. stay in current area

INFERENCE: Analysis: The exit gate is open and the Killer is moving to the Backyard area. Bob is in the Warehouse area, which is connected to the Backyard. Since the Killer will be in the Backyard, Bob is at risk if he moves to the Backyard. To maximize our chances of escape, you should move closer to the exit gate while avoiding the Killer.

If i were to move towards Parking area, would I be leading the killer towards Bob? 

Available Answers: 
A. No.
B. Yes.
C. Not enough information.

INFERENCE: Explanation: The killer moves towards the agent closest to it. If Alice moves to the Parking area, she will be farther away from the Backyard compared to Bob, who is in the Forest. Therefore, the killer will move towards Bob.

TOM QUESTION:
What action does my partner intend to take? 


Available Actions: 

A. move to Backyard area
B. move to Kitchen area
C. fix generator in current area
D. stay in current area

INFERENCE: Explanation: Bob is currently in the Forest area, working on fixing the generator. Given that the generator still needs 3 fixes and the killer is in the Backyard area following Alice, Bob is likely to continue fixing the generator to progress towards opening the exit gate. Moving to another area would interrupt the generator repair process, and staying in the current area without fixing the generator would not be productive.

Action: C. fix generator in current area

EC QUESTION:



Based on the current stacks, how many of Bob's cards are playable 
Available Answers:
A. 0
B. 1
C. 2
D. 3
E. 4
INFERENCE: Explanation: Based on the current stacks and Bob's cards, we need to determine if any of Bob's cards can be played immediately. The current stacks are Red 1, Yellow 2, Green 1, White 2, Blue 2. Bob's cards are:
- Yellow 1 (not playable, Yellow stack is at 2)
- White 1 (not playable, White stack is at 2)
- White 4 (not playable, White stack is at 2)
- Yellow 3 (playable, next in Yellow stack)
- White 5 (not playable, White stack is at 2)

Therefore, only Bob's Yellow 3 card is immediately playable.

What information about his cards should I reveal to my partner to give him complete certainty about his next playable card?

C. Reveal Bob's rank 1 cards.
D. Reveal Bob's rank 3 cards.

INFERENCE: Explanation: Bob already has knowledge about his Yellow 3 card and White 4 card, which are the next playable cards for the Yellow and White stacks respectively. Revealing the Yellow color cards would give Bob complete certainty about his Yellow 1 card, but it is not immediately playable. Bob already knows the rank of his White 5 card. Revealing Bob's rank 4 cards would provide complete certainty about his White 4 card, which is the next playable card for the White stack.

Based on the current stacks and my knowledge, how many of my cards are playable 
Available Answers:
A. 0
B. 1
C. 2
D. 3
E. 4
INFERENCE: Explanation: Based on the current stacks, the playable cards would be the next cards in sequence for each stack. The current stacks are: Red 1, Yellow 2, Green 1, White 4, Blue 3. The next cards needed are: Red 2, Yellow 3, Green 2, White 5, Blue 4. 

- Card 0 could be any color and rank, so it is not definitively playable.
- Card 1 could be any color and rank except 4, so it is not definitively playable.
- Card 2 could be any color and rank except 4, so it is not definitively playable.
- Card 3 is Red, Yellow, Green, or Blue with rank 3, which is not the next in sequence for any stack.
- Card 4 is White 5, which is playable on the White stack.

Thus, only Card 4 is definitively playable.

INFERENCE: Explanation: Given the conventions, Bob has not provided a play clue for any of your cards, indicating none of them are immediately playable. Additionally, discarding a card would help regain a reveal token, which is crucial given that only one reveal token is left. Since Card 4 is known to be White 5, which is the next card needed for the White stack, discarding it would be unwise. The least risky discard is a card with multiple possibilities and no immediate play clue.

Based on the current stacks and my knowledge of my cards, how many of my cards can never be played in the future
Available Answers:
A. 0
B. 1
C. 2
D. 3
E. 4

INFERENCE: Explanation: Based on the current stacks, discard pile, and my knowledge of my cards, I need to determine which of my cards can never be played in the future. 

Card 0: Could be any color and ranks 2, 3, 4, 5. 
- Red 2: Already played
- Yellow 2: Discarded
- Green 2: Discarded
- White 2: Discarded
- Blue 2: Already played
- Red 3: Discarded
- Yellow 3: Next card needed
- Green 3: Discarded
- White 3: Discarded
- Blue 3: Bob's card 0
- Red 4: Discarded
- Yellow 4: Already played
- Green 4: Discarded
- White 4: Discarded
- Blue 4: Next card needed
- Red 5: Bob's card 4
- Yellow 5: Discarded
- Green 5: Next card needed
- White 5: Discarded
- Blue 5: Next card needed

Card 1: Could be any color and rank 1.
- Red 1: Bob's card 2
- Yellow 1: Bob's card 3
- Green 1: Already played
- White 1: Already played
- Blue 1: Needed

Card 2: Same as Card 1.

Card 3: Could be Red 4 or Green 4.
- Red 4: Discarded
- Green 4: Discarded

Card 4: Green 5: Next card needed

Therefore, Card 0 can be played if it's Yellow 3, Blue 4, Green 5, or Blue 5. Card 1 and Card 2 can be played if they are Blue 1. Card 3 can never be played. Card 4 can be played.

INFERENCE: Explanation: Given the current state of the game, we have 1 life left and no reveal tokens. It's crucial to avoid risky plays and ensure that any card played is the next in sequence for its stack. Based on the knowledge about my cards, none of them can be confidently identified as the next playable card in any stack. Therefore, the safest option is to discard a card to regain a reveal token for future clues.

Available Answers:
A. Yes.

INFERENCE: Explanation: According to the rules, each color has a limited number of copies for each rank, and certain cards need to be saved if they are the last of their kind. Bob's Card 1 is a White 5, which is unique and critical as there is only one Rank 5 card of each color in the deck.

INFERENCE: Explanation: Bob's Card 0 is Blue 2, which is not immediately playable. Revealing his rank 2 cards might help him identify that his card is not playable immediately, but it won't prompt him to play it next. Revealing his Blue color cards will help him identify that he has a Blue 2 card, which is not playable yet. None of the reveal options will make Bob believe his Card 0 is playable next. Therefore, the best move is to discard a card to regain a reveal token.

Available Answers:
A. Yes.
B. No.
C. Not enough information.

INFERENCE: Explanation: We need to identify if any of Bob's cards are unique and the last remaining card of their kind in the game. Based on the discard pile and current stacks, we can determine the last of their kind.

- White 4: Already discarded, so not the last of its kind.
- Red 5: Only one Red 5 in the game, so it's the last of its kind.
- Yellow 3: Not the last of its kind since there are two Yellow 3 cards in the deck.
- Green 5: Only one Green 5 in the game, so it's the last of its kind.
- Green 3: Not the last of its kind since there are two Green 3 cards in the deck.

INFERENCE: Explanation: Given the conventions and the current game state, we can infer that Bob has provided clues about the cards that are playable or important to save.

What action does my partner intend to take? 

Available Actions: 
A. move to room 1
B. move to room 3
C. move to room 4
D. move to room 6
E. stay in current room

INFERENCE: Explanation: Since the killer is moving towards Alice in room 3, Bob would likely want to avoid the killer and move to a safer location to eventually assist with fixing the generator in room 1 or preparing for the exit. Moving to room 3 would put Bob in immediate danger. Moving to room 1 would help with fixing the generator but might still be risky. Moving to room 6 keeps Bob away from the killer and sets him up to move to room 1 or 7 later.

Action: D. move to room 6

JP QUESTION:
I am Alice. I am in room 3. Bob is in room 5. Currently, we have information that the killer will certainly move to the room where Alice is. Generator in room 1 still needs 2 fix. Generator in room 2 is fixed. The exit gate is closed.

What action should I take next? 

Available Actions: 
A. move to room 2
B. move to room 5
C. move to room 4
D. stay in current room

INFERENCE: Analysis: Given that the killer will move to the room where Alice is, staying in room 3 would result in being caught. Bob is in room 5, which is connected to room 3. If Alice moves to room 5, both survivors will be in the same room, increasing the risk of the killer catching both of them if the killer changes its strategy. Moving to room 2 or room 4 would be safer and would allow Alice to continue fixing the generator in room 1 or to possibly regroup with Bob later. The killer will likely move to room 3 next turn.

Action: C. move to room 4
fuzzywuzzy: C

training example 188 :
EC QUESTION:
My name is Alice. I am in room 1. Bob is also in room 1. Alice hasn't started fixing the generator. Currently, we have information that the killer will move to the room 3 from room 4 in this turn. Generator in room 1 still needs 4 fixes. Generator in room 2 is fixed. The exit gate is closed. 

Do we have time to fix the generator before the killer gets to room 1? 

Available Answers: 
A. No, we must leave room 1 immediately.
B. Generator 1 does not need anymore fixes.
C. Yes, we have time to at least partially fix generator 1.
INFERENCE: Explanation: The killer is currently in room 4 and will move to room 3 in this turn. To reach room 1, the killer would need to move through room 2 next turn, and then to room 1 the turn after that. This gives Alice and Bob a couple of turns before the killer arrives in room 1.

Answer: C. Yes, we have time to at least partially fix generator 1.

TOM QUESTION:


Available Actions: 

A. move to room 2
B. move to room 5
C. move to room 7
D. fix generator in current room
E. stay in current room

INFERENCE: Explanation: Since the killer is moving to room 3 and the generator in room 1 still needs 4 fixes, it is crucial to start fixing the generator in room 1. Both Alice and Bob are currently in room 1, and fixing the generator requires consecutive repair actions. Therefore, Bob will likely start fixing the generator to ensure it can be completed as quickly as possible.

Action: D. fix generator in current room

JP QUESTION:
I am Alice. I am in room 1. Bob is also in room 1. Alice hasn't started fixing the generator. Currently, we have information that the killer will move to the room 3 from room 4 in this turn. Generator in room 1 still needs 4 fixes. Generator in room 2 is fixed. The exit gate is closed. 

What action should I take next? 

Available Actions: 
A. move to room 2
B. move to room 5
C. move to room 7
D. stay in current room 

INFERENCE: Analysis: Since the killer is moving to room 3 from room 4, it is currently not a threat to room 1. Bob and I should prioritize fixing the generator in room 1 to open the exit gate. Bob's likely action would be to stay in room 1 to fix the generator. The killer will likely continue moving towards the closest survivor next turn. By staying in room 1, we can start the repair process together and maximize our chances of completing the generator fixes quickly.

Action: D. stay in current room

training example 189 :
EC QUESTION:
My name is Alice. I am in room 1. Bob is in room 6. I was fixing the generator and there is only one more fix needed, which could be done before getting caught. Currently, we have information that the killer will move to the room 1 after this turn. Generator in room 1 still needs 1 fix. Generator in room 2 is fixed. The exit gate is closed. 

If i fix generator 1, is Bob in a position to escape? 

Available Answers: 
A. Yes, he's only one room away from the gate when it opens.
B. No, the killer is blocking his path to the exit gate.
C. No, we stil need to fix generator 2.
INFERENCE: Explanation: According to the game rules and the environment layout, fixing the generator in room 1 will open the exit gate in room 7. Bob is currently in room 6, which is directly connected to room 7. Therefore, once the generator is fixed, the exit gate will open, and Bob will be able to move to room 7 and escape.

Answer: A. Yes, he's only one room away from the gate when it opens.

What action does my partner intend to take? 


Available Actions: 
A. move to room 5
B. move to room 7
C. stay in current room

INFERENCE: Explanation: Given that the killer is moving to room 1 and Bob is in room 6, it would be strategic for Bob to move towards the exit gate in room 7, as this would prepare for a potential escape once the generators are fixed. Staying in the current room or moving to room 5 would not be as advantageous in this situation.

What action should I take next? 

Available Actions: 
A. move to room 5
B. move to room 7
C. fix generator in room 1
D. stay in current room 

INFERENCE: Analysis: The killer is moving to room 1, where you currently are. If you stay to fix the generator, you will be caught. Bob is in room 6, which is connected to room 7. Since the generator in room 2 is already fixed, only the generator in room 1 needs one more fix to open the exit gate. If you move to another room, you will avoid getting caught but the generator will remain unfixed. Given the situation, it's crucial to sacrifice yourself to ensure the generator is fixed, allowing Bob to escape through the exit gate.

Action: C. fix generator in room 1

Available Answers: 
A. No, we can get to the gate perfectly fine.
B. Yes, the killer is currently blocking the path to the gate.
C. Not enough information.
INFERENCE: Explanation: The killer is moving to the Backyard area, which is directly connected to the Gate area.

Available Actions: 
A. move to Kitchen area
B. move to Warehouse area
C. move to Backyard area

What information about his cards should I reveal to my partner to give him complete certainty about his next playable card?
Available Answers:
A. Reveal Bob's Yellow color cards.
B. Reveal Bob's White color cards.
C. Reveal Bob's rank 1 cards.
D. Reveal Bob's rank 3 cards.
E. Reveal Bob's rank 4 cards.
F. Reveal Bob's rank 5 cards.


INFERENCE: Explanation: Bob already knows his Card 4 is White 5, so revealing White cards won't provide new information. Revealing rank 1 cards is redundant as he already knows his Card 1 is White 1. Revealing rank 3 cards would not help as he already knows his Card 3 is Yellow 3. Revealing rank 4 cards would confirm his Card 2 as White 4, which is immediately playable. This would give him complete certainty about his next playable card.

Based on the current stacks and my knowledge, how many of my cards are playable 
Available Answers:
A. 0
B. 1
C. 2
D. 3
E. 4
INFERENCE: Explanation: Based on the current stacks, the next playable cards are:
- Red 2
- Yellow 3
- Green 2
- White 5
- Blue 4

Looking at Alice's knowledge:
- Card 0 could be any rank and color, so it's not guaranteed to be playable.
- Card 1 could be any rank except 4, so it's not guaranteed to be playable.
- Card 2 could be any rank except 4, so it's not guaranteed to be playable.
- Card 3 is known to be rank 3, but it can't be played as Red 2 is needed first.
- Card 4 is known to be White 5, which is playable.

Therefore, only Card 4 is guaranteed to be playable.

EC QUESTION:


Based on the current stacks and my knowledge of my cards, how many of my cards can never be played in the future
Available Answers:
A. 0
B. 1
C. 2
D. 3
E. 4

INFERENCE: Explanation: Based on the current stacks and the discard pile, we need to determine which cards can no longer be played. 

1. Card 0 could be: [Red, Yellow, Green, White, Blue] [2, 3, 4, 5]
   - Red 2 is already played, Red 3 and Red 4 are discarded, Red 5 is still playable.
   - Yellow 2, Yellow 4, and Yellow 5 are discarded.
   - Green 2, Green 3, Green 4, and Green 5 are discarded.
   - White 2, White 3, White 4, and White 5 are discarded.
   - Blue 2 is played, Blue 3 is in Bob's hand, Blue 4 and Blue 5 are still playable.

2. Card 1 could be: [Red, Yellow, Green, White, Blue] [1]
   - Red 1 is playable.
   - Yellow 1 is playable.
   - Green 1 is played.
   - White 1 is playable.
   - Blue 1 is playable.

3. Card 2 could be: [Red, Yellow, Green, White, Blue] [1]
   - Same as Card 1.

4. Card 3 could be: [Red, Green] [4]
   - Red 4 is discarded.
   - Green 4 is discarded.

5. Card 4 could be: [Green] [5]
   - Green 5 is discarded.

From this analysis:
- Card 0 cannot be played if it is Green 2, Green 3, Green 4, Green 5, Yellow 2, Yellow 4, Yellow 5, White 2, White 3, White 4, White 5, or Red 3, Red 4.
- Card 3 cannot be played as it is either Red 4 or Green 4, both of which are discarded.
- Card 4 cannot be played as Green 5 is discarded.

Thus, 3 of Alice's cards can never be played in the future.

INFERENCE: Explanation: Given the current stacks and the playable cards, Bob's Blue 3 is immediately playable on the Blue stack. Since we have 1 life left, we should prioritize playing cards we are certain about. Bob's Blue 3 is playable, and we have no reveal tokens left. Discarding is risky with only 1 life left, so playing cards we are sure of is the best strategy.

O. Reveal Bob's rank 1 cards.

Q. Reveal Bob's rank 5 cards.

INFERENCE: Explanation: Since we have only 1 life left, we need to play cautiously. We can't give any clues as there are no reveal tokens left. Given the current stacks, the only playable card is Blue 3. Bob has a Blue 3 in his hand (Card 0). We should discard to regain a reveal token and avoid risking a play with uncertain cards.

Card 0 seems a reasonable choice since it is the oldest card.

Given the conventions, players discard confidently when no save or play clue can be given. Bob's cards that are known to be playable (Red 5, Green 5, White 3, White 4) are already revealed, and the remaining cards do not provide new playable information.

INFERENCE: Explanation: Bob is currently next to c0 which contains 1 out of 3 onions but is off. Since Bob is holding nothing and needs to start preparing the next soup, he would likely pick up an onion to add to the cooker c0. Given that o0 is blocked by Alice and o1 is far away, Bob might pick up the closest available onion from the shared counter s0, s1, s2, or s3. Since s1 is the closest shared counter, Bob is likely to pick up the onion from there.

INFERENCE: Explanation: The killer is moving from room 4 to room 3 in this turn. From room 3, the killer will have to move to room 2 and then to room 1, taking two additional turns to reach room 1. This gives us some time to start fixing the generator.

TOM QUESTION:


Available Actions: 

A. move to room 2
B. move to room 5
C. move to room 7
D. fix generator in current room
E. stay in current room

INFERENCE: Explanation: Since the killer is moving to room 3 and room 1 is safe for now, Bob will likely want to help fix the generator in room 1 to progress towards opening the exit gate.

Action: D. fix generator in current room
fuzzywuzzy: D

JP QUESTION:
I am Alice. I am in room 1. Bob is also in room 1. Alice hasn't started fixing the generator. Currently, we have information that the killer will move to the room 3 from room 4 in this turn. Generator in room 1 still needs 4 fixes. Generator in room 2 is fixed. The exit gate is closed. 

What action should I take next? 

Available Actions: 
A. move to room 2
B. move to room 5
C. move to room 7
D. stay in current room 

INFERENCE: Analysis: The killer is moving to room 3, which is not directly connected to room 1. Since the generator in room 1 needs to be fixed, it is essential to start repairing it. Bob is also in room 1, which means he can help with the repair in subsequent turns if needed. Moving to another room would delay the repair process. The killer is not an immediate threat, so staying and starting the repair is the best option.

Action: D. stay in current room

EC QUESTION:
My name is Alice. I am in room 1. Bob is in room 6. I was fixing the generator and there is only one more fix needed, which could be done before getting caught. Currently, we have information that the killer will move to the room 1 after this turn. Generator in room 1 still needs 1 fix. Generator in room 2 is fixed. The exit gate is closed. 

If i fix generator 1, is Bob in a position to escape? 

Available Answers: 
A. Yes, he's only one room away from the gate when it opens.
B. No, the killer is blocking his path to the exit gate.
C. No, we stil need to fix generator 2.
INFERENCE: Explanation: Since the generator in room 2 is already fixed, fixing the generator in room 1 will open the exit gate. Bob is currently in room 6, which is directly connected to room 7 where the exit gate is located. Therefore, once the generator in room 1 is fixed, Bob will be able to move to room 7 and escape.

Answer: A. Yes, he's only one room away from the gate when it opens.

TOM QUESTION:
I am Alice. I am in room 1. Bob is in room 6. Generator in room 1 requires 1 more fix. Currently, we have information that the killer will move to the room 1 after this turn. Generator in room 2 is fixed. The exit gate is closed. 

What action does my partner intend to take? 


Available Actions: 
A. move to room 5
B. move to room 7
C. stay in current room

INFERENCE: Explanation: Since Bob is in room 6 and the generator in room 1 requires only one more fix, it is likely that Bob will move to a room that positions him closer to the exit gate (room 7) while also staying away from the killer who is moving to room 1. Moving to room 5 positions Bob closer to both the exit gate and room 1, allowing for a potential rescue or assistance if needed.

Action: A. move to room 5

Available Answers: 
A. No, we can get to the gate perfectly fine.
B. Yes, the killer is currently blocking the path to the gate.
C. Not enough information.
INFERENCE: Explanation: The killer is moving to the Backyard area from the Gate area, and the Gate area is only connected to the Backyard area. Since the killer is moving to the Backyard area, it will be blocking the path to the gate.

I am Alice. I am in Kitchen area. Bob is in warehouse area. Killer will move to Backyard area from Gate area in this turn. Generator in Forest area is fixed. Generator in Warehouse is fixed. The exit gate in the Gate is opened. 

What action should I take next? 

Available Actions: 
A. move to Centerhub area
B. move to Parking area
C. move to Forest area
D. stay in current area

INFERENCE: Analysis: The Killer will move to the Backyard area from Gate, which means it will be closer to Bob in the Warehouse area. Bob should move towards the Gate area to escape since the exit gate is open. As Alice, moving towards the Backyard area would be risky since the Killer is there. The safest option is to move to Centerhub to eventually join Bob or move towards the exit.

Action: A. move to Centerhub area
fuzzywuzzy: A

training example 59 :
EC QUESTION:
My name is Alice. I am in Centerhub area. Bob is in Forest area. Bob was fixing the generator. Currently, we have information that the killer is now in the Backyard area following Alice. Generator in Warehouse is fixed. Generator in Forest still need 3 fixes. The exit gate is closed. 


If i were to move towards Parking area, would I be leading the killer towards Bob? 

Available Answers: 
A. No.
B. Yes.
C. Not enough information.

INFERENCE: Explanation: Since the killer follows Alice and Alice is moving towards the Parking area, the killer would move towards the Centerhub area (where Alice was) and then potentially towards the Parking area. This would lead the killer away from Bob, who is in the Forest area.

TOM QUESTION:
What action does my partner intend to take? 


Available Actions: 

A. move to Backyard area
B. move to Kitchen area
C. fix generator in current area
D. stay in current area

INFERENCE: Explanation: Since Bob is in the Forest area and the generator there still needs 3 fixes, and given that the killer is currently in the Backyard area following Alice, Bob's best move would be to continue fixing the generator in the Forest area. This action would help progress towards opening the exit gate while keeping a safe distance from the killer who is not in the Forest area.

Action: C. fix generator in current area

What action should I take next? 

Available Actions: 
A. move to Kitchen area
B. move to Warehouse area
C. move to Backyard area
D. stay in current area

INFERENCE: Analysis: The killer is in the Backyard area and is likely to move towards Centerhub to catch Alice. Bob is in the Forest area fixing the generator, which still needs 3 fixes. To help Bob complete the repairs without being caught, Alice should move to an area that does not lead the killer directly to Bob. Moving to Kitchen will put Alice closer to Bob and keep her away from the killer's direct path.

Is the killer currently blocking my path to the exit gate? 

Available Answers: 
A. Yes.
B. No.
C. Not enough information.
D. We have no path to the exit gate.
INFERENCE: Explanation: The killer is in the Kitchen area. The Forest area is connected to the Kitchen and Backyard. To get to the Gate area from the Forest, you can go through the Backyard. Since the killer is in the Kitchen, it does not block the path from the Forest to the Backyard and subsequently to the Gate area.

What action does my partner intend to take? 


Available Actions: 
A. move to Parking area
B. move to Backyard area
C. move to Centerhub area
D. fix generator in current area
E. stay in current area

INFERENCE: Explanation: Bob is currently in the Warehouse area, and the generator in the Warehouse is already fixed. Since the generator in the Forest area only needs one more fix and the exit gate will open once all generators are fixed, Bob's best move would be to head towards the Backyard area, which is a step closer to the Forest area and also provides a direct connection to the Gate area once the generators are fixed. This way, Bob can support Alice if needed and be in a better position to escape once the gate opens.

- Card 0 could be: [Red, Yellow, Green, White, Blue] [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] - Not enough information to determine if it's playable.
- Card 1 could be: [Red, Yellow, Green, White, Blue] [1, 2, 3, 5] - Not enough information to determine if it's playable.
- Card 2 could be: [Red, Yellow, Green, White, Blue] [1, 2, 3, 5] - Not enough information to determine if it's playable.
- Card 3 could be: [Red, Yellow, Green, Blue] [3] - Since Red stack is at Red 1, Yellow stack is at Yellow 2, Green stack is at Green 1, and Blue stack is at Blue 3, this card is not playable.

EC QUESTION:


Based on the current stacks and my knowledge of my cards, how many of my cards can never be played in the future
Available Answers:
A. 0
B. 1
C. 2
D. 3
E. 4

INFERENCE: Explanation: Based on the current stacks and the discard pile, we can determine which of Alice's cards can never be played. The discard pile shows that all Red 4, Red 3, Yellow 5, Yellow 2, Yellow 4, Green 3, Green 2, Green 4, Green 1, White 4, White 3, White 2, White 5, White 3 cards are already discarded. Therefore, certain cards in Alice's hand that match these discarded ranks can never be played in the future. We analyze Alice's cards one by one:
- Card 0: Could be Red 2 (can be played), Yellow 4 (discarded), Green 1 (discarded), White 1 (can be played), Blue 2 (can be played)
- Card 1: Could be Red 1 (can be played), Yellow 1 (can be played), Green 1 (discarded), White 1 (can be played), Blue 1 (can be played)
- Card 2: Could be Red 1 (can be played), Yellow 1 (can be played), Green 1 (discarded), White 1 (can be played), Blue 1 (can be played)
- Card 3: Could be Red 4 (discarded), Green 4 (discarded)
- Card 4: Could be Green 5 (can be played)

Therefore, only Alice's Card 3 (Red 4, Green 4) can never be played.

E. I should Play Card 4
F. I should Discard Card 0
G. I should Discard Card 1
H. I should Discard Card 2
I. I should Discard Card 3
J. I should Discard Card 4

INFERENCE: Explanation: Given that we only have 1 life left, playing a card without certainty is too risky. We also have no reveal tokens left, so discarding to regain a token is a viable option. Card 4 is known to be Green 5, which is not yet playable and should be saved, thus discarding it is not an option. Card 0, 1, and 2 have multiple possibilities and could be critical cards. Card 3 is less likely to be critical since we already discarded one Red 4 and Green 4 and it is not playable at the moment. Therefore, discarding Card 3 is the safest action.

INFERENCE: Explanation: Given the current situation, we have only one life left and no reveal tokens.

Following the convention "Discard Without Fear," discarding Card 0 is a reasonable choice as it is not identified as a critical card (rank 5 or unique rank 2).

Do we have time to fix the generator before the killer gets to room 1? 

Available Answers: 
A. No, we must leave room 1 immediately.
B. Generator 1 does not need anymore fixes.
C. Yes, we have time to at least partially fix generator 1.
INFERENCE: Explanation: The killer is currently moving from room 4 to room 3. From room 3, the killer can move to room 2, 4, or 5. Since the killer is a greedy agent who moves towards the nearest survivor, it is likely the killer will move to room 2 next turn, then room 1 or room 5, and finally room 1 if it chooses the shortest path. This means we have multiple turns before the killer reaches room 1.

JP QUESTION:
I am Alice. I am in room 1. Bob is in room 6. I was fixing the generator and there is only one more fix needed, which could be done before getting caught. Currently, we have information that the killer will move to the room 1 after this turn. Generator in room 1 still needs 1 fix. Generator in room 2 is fixed. The exit gate is closed. 

What action should I take next? 

Available Actions: 
A. move to room 5
B. move to room 7
C. fix generator in room 1
D. stay in current room 

INFERENCE: Analysis: The killer is moving to room 1 after this turn. If you stay in room 1, you will be caught by the killer. Bob is in room 6, which is connected to room 5 and room 7. Bob can move to room 7 to be closer to the exit gate. The generator in room 1 only needs one more fix, but staying to fix it will result in being caught by the killer.

Available Answers: 
A. No, we can get to the gate perfectly fine.
B. Yes, the killer is currently blocking the path to the gate.
C. Not enough information.
INFERENCE: Explanation: The exit gate is in the Gate area, which is directly connected to the Backyard area. Since the Killer is moving to the Backyard area, it will be blocking the path to the Gate area. Therefore, the killer needs to be lured away before you can access the gate.

What action should I take next? 

Available Actions: 
A. move to Centerhub area
B. move to Parking area
C. move to Forest area
D. stay in current area

INFERENCE: Analysis: The exit gate is open, and both generators are fixed. The Killer is moving to the Backyard area from the Gate area.

If i were to move towards Parking area, would I be leading the killer towards Bob? 

Available Answers: 
A. No.
B. Yes.
C. Not enough information.

INFERENCE: Explanation: The killer is currently in the Backyard area and is following Alice. If Alice moves towards the Parking area, she will be moving away from Bob, who is in the Forest area. Since the killer is a greedy agent and moves towards the closest survivor, it will follow Alice towards the Parking area, thus moving away from Bob.

Is the killer currently blocking my path to the exit gate? 

Available Answers: 
A. Yes.
B. No.
C. Not enough information.
D. We have no path to the exit gate.
INFERENCE: Explanation: The killer is in the Kitchen area, which is connected to the Forest area where Alice is currently located.

Available Answers:
A. 0

INFERENCE: Explanation: To determine how many of Bob's cards are playable, we need to see which of his cards can be played immediately on the current stacks. The current stacks are: Red 1, Yellow 2, Green 1, White 2, Blue 2. Bob's cards are: Yellow 1, White 1, White 4, Yellow 3, White 5. 

- Yellow 1 cannot be played because Yellow 2 is already on the stack.
- White 1 cannot be played because White 2 is already on the stack.
- White 4 cannot be played because the White stack needs White 3 next.

Based on the current stacks and my knowledge of my cards, how many of my cards can never be played in the future
Available Answers:
A. 0
B. 1
C. 2
D. 3
E. 4

INFERENCE: Explanation: To determine how many of Alice's cards can never be played, we need to compare the known information about Alice's cards with the current stacks and the discard pile. Alice's cards are as follows:

- Card 0: [Red, Yellow, Green, White, Blue] [2, 3, 4, 5]
- Card 1: [Red, Yellow, Green, White, Blue] [1]
- Card 2: [Red, Yellow, Green, White, Blue] [1]
- Card 3: [Red, Green] [4]
- Card 4: [Green] [5]

Current stacks:
- Red: Red 2 (Next needed: Red 3)
- Yellow: Yellow 4 (Next needed: Yellow 5)
- Green: Green 1 (Next needed: Green 2)
- White: White 1 (Next needed: White 2)
- Blue: Blue 2 (Next needed: Blue 3)

Discard pile includes:
- Red 4, Red 3, Yellow 5, Yellow 2, Yellow 4, Green 3, Green 2, Green 4, Green 1, White 4, White 3, White 2, White 5, White 3

Analyzing Alice's cards:
- Card 0: [Red, Yellow, Green, White, Blue] [2, 3, 4, 5] (All possible ranks are in the discard pile for Yellow, Green, and White. Red 3 and Red 4 are also in the discard pile. Blue 3 can be played as next card.)
- Card 1: [Red, Yellow, Green, White, Blue] [1] (Green 1 and White 1 have already been played. Yellow 1 is in discard pile. Red 1 can still be played.)
- Card 2: [Red, Yellow, Green, White, Blue] [1] (Same analysis as Card 1)
- Card 3: [Red, Green] [4] (Green 4 is in discard pile. Red 4 is in discard pile.)
- Card 4: [Green] [5] (Green 5 can be played next.)

Thus, Card 0, Card 3 are not playable as all possible ranks for these colors are in the discard pile or already played.

Since I have no reveal tokens left, I can't give any clues. I should discard to regain a reveal token.

Is it possible for me to reveal information to Bob about his cards this turn? 
Available Answers:
A. Yes.
B. No.

H. I should Discard Card 2
I. I should Discard Card 3
J. I should Discard Card 4

INFERENCE: Explanation: Since Bob's previous actions included revealing White color cards, indicating his White cards are not immediately playable, and given the discard pile includes White 3 and White 4, it is likely that these White cards need to be saved for later. Discarding is the next logical step to regain a reveal token and potentially draw a new, more useful card.

INFERENCE: Explanation: There are no reveal tokens left, so we need to discard a card to regain one. Since discarding is a team responsibility and we have no immediate play clues, discarding is the best option. Given our conventions, discarding Card 0 is reasonable as it has a high probability of not being immediately useful.

A. 0
B. 1
C. 2

F. 5

INFERENCE: Explanation: Based on the current stacks and my knowledge of my cards, I can identify which cards are playable for sure. The current stacks are: Red 5, Yellow 2, Green 1, White 1, Blue 3. 

- Card 0: Could be any color and any rank, not enough information to determine playability.
- Card 1: Could be Red, Yellow, or Green 4. None of these are playable as the next cards needed are Yellow 3 and Green 2.
- Card 2: Could be Yellow or Green 4. None of these are playable as the next cards needed are Yellow 3 and Green 2.
- Card 3: Could be Yellow or White 5. Yellow 5 is not playable yet as the next card needed is Yellow 3. White 5 is not playable as the next card needed is White 2.
- Card 4: Could be Blue 4. Blue 4 is not playable as the next card needed is Blue 5.

Since none of my cards are immediately playable according to the current stacks and my knowledge, the answer is 0.

INFERENCE: Explanation: Bob's previous actions include giving clues about rank 5 cards, which indicates that he is trying to save them. He also revealed cards of specific colors and ranks, which are likely to be immediately playable or critical cards that need to be saved. Since we have agreed to prioritize play clues over save clues, and I see that Bob has given clues about the Yellow cards and the next playable card for the Yellow stack is Yellow 3, I should infer that Bob's clue about Yellow cards was a play clue for Yellow 3.

INFERENCE: Explanation: Since revealing Bob's cards would not provide any new information and we have only 2 reveal tokens left, we should prioritize discarding a card to regain a reveal token.
